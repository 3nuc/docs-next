# Transition & Animations Overview

Vue offers some abstractions that can help work with transitions and animations, particularly in response to something changing. Some of these abstractions include:

- Hooks for components entering and leaving the DOM, in both CSS and JS
- Transition Modes so that you can orchestrate ordering during a transition
- Hooks for when multiple elements are updating in position, with FLIP techniques applied under the hood to increase performance
- Ways to transition different states in an application

We will cover all of these and more in the next two sections in this Guide. Aside from these useful API offerings, it's worth mentioning that the class and style declarations we covered earlier can be used to apply animations and transitions as well, for simpler use cases.

In this next section, we'll go over some web animation and transitions basics, for those who are just learning, as well as linking off to some good resources. If you're already familiar with web animation and how those principles might work with some of Vue's directives, feel free to skip this next section. For anyone else looking to learn a little more about web animation basics before diving in, read on.
